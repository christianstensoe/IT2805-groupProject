        <h2>Our Client</h2>
        <ul id="client_list">
            <li> Client name: Morrofilm AS </li>
            <li> Contact person: Markus Jørgensen</li>  
        </ul>
        <p>
            Morrofilm AS is a startup based in Trondheim, which focuses on challenging established companies in the sector through innovation,
            lower prices, and hosting interactive events. Morrofilm AS was founded by Markus Jørgensen (CEO) while he was studying nano-technology and 
            applied physics at NTNU. Markus loved going to the cinema with his friends, but thought that the prices were too high for a student, and he only wanted to watch two of the twenty available movies. 
            Markus says that he will donate the surplus from the company to goodwill in Trondheim, in order to ensure that everyone is able to experience Morrofilm. 
            After a thorough discussion with Markus we plan to create a website called "Morrofilm.no"

        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>The audience of the website would be all kinds of people that either wants to find information about movies, when they are shown or have the oppurtunity to buy tickets.
            The age of the audience could be anything between kids and older people. All kinds of people could go to the cinema, so the audience for this website would generally be very broad.
            Therefore the typically user for the website could be difficult to describe exactly, but considering that the company Morrofilm is aiming to reach out to a broader group of audience with their cheaper tickets relative to the established cinemas, we could possibly expect a higher occurance of teenagers, students and younger adults in the audience.</p>

        <h2>Functional and Non-functional Requirements</h2>
        <p>After getting the wishes and preferences from the client we can divide these requirements into two main categories; functional and non-functional. 
            The three most fundamental requirements for the website would be the possibility to buy tickets, to get information about when the different movies are shown and to be able to read more about the different movies. 
            These three requirements are described as functional because they describe functions that is critical to the website.
            Among the non-functional requirements we firstly have the requirement that the website should be designed in a way so that it would be easy to understand and interact with for everyone. 
            For instance this means that the website should be understandable for both young and old people, and it should not be designed in a way that requires the users to be especially compentent within data or IT.
            Secondly, the client wants the website to have a minimalistic design, with a layout that looks clear and neat, and thirdly the client wants the website shall prioritize visuals, such as images and eventually videos 
        </p>

        <h3>Additional Specific Preferences</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The colours should be easy to read, even for people with colour blindness</li>
            <li>Merry colours that promotes contrast and the vision of Morrofilm</li>
            <li>The site should be interactive (possibility for voting over movies)</li>
            <li>Navigating the site should be intuitive no matter if you are familiar with websites</li>
        </ul> 

        <h3>Technical Difficulties</h3>
        <p>The client wants to embed trailers for every movie on the site. This may affect the loading time of the website.
            It's something we need to take into consideration and be aware of.

        <h2> Purpose goals and audience </h2>

        <p> The purpose is still to make a website that people can visit to buy tickets to the cinema, and also get information about the movies shown in the cinema.
            The website should be easy to access for everybody, as the audience for the website is a very broad group of people. In order to achieve this the website has to be intuitive as well as having a good layout that also makes
            the visitors of the website feel like it is an easy-to-understand website.</p>

        <h2> Navigation Structure</h2>

        <p>The navigation structure is a clique where every page is connected to every other page.
            The reason for this is the menu at the top of each page, which is the same no matter which page you are on.
            The user can access any of the pages through this menu at all time.

        <h2> Plan </h2>

        <p> The following list is what we call an organizational scheme and will be the base for how we plan to organize all the files, folders etc. together in our group.
            Note that we are still in an early phase of the project, so it is quite hard to make a very accurate scheme, and there could absolotely be made changes to this scheme
            at a later time. The organizational scheme shown below is put in a folder called "Morrofilm AS" </p>

        <h3> Organizational Scheme: </h3>

        <ul>
            <li> css 
                <ul>

                </ul>
            </li>

            <li> img 
                <ul>

        <h2> Plan </h2>

        <p> The following list is what we call an organizational scheme and will be the base for how we plan to organize all the files, folders etc. together in our group.
            Note that we are still in an early phase of the project, so it is quite hard to make a very accurate scheme, and there could absolotely be made changes to this scheme
            at a later time. The organizational scheme shown below is put in a folder called "Morrofilm AS" </p>

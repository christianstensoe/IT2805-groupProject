        <h2> Purpose goals and audience </h2>

        <p> The purpose is still to make a website that people can visit to buy tickets to the cinema, and also get information about the movies shown in the cinema.
            The website should be easy to access for everybody, as the audience for the website is a very broad group of people. In order to achieve this the website has to be intuitive as well as having a good layout that also makes
            the visitors of the website feel like it is an easy-to-understand website.</p>

        <h2> Navigation Structure</h2>

        <p>The navigation structure is a clique where every page is connected to every other page.
            The reason for this is the menu at the top of each page, which is the same no matter which page you are on.
            The user can access any of the pages through this menu at all time. </p>
      
        <p>The reason for why we chose this navigation structure is to give the user an intuitive access to each page at all times. Each new page has its own button, and there is no need for the user to hover over anything to view hidden buttons.</p>

        <h2> Page Layout and Appearance </h2>

        <h3>Font</h3>

        <h2> Content </h2>

        
        <h3>Home page: </h3>

        <p>The Home (Landing) page of MorroFilm AS serves as the gateway to the website, welcoming visitors and providing an overview of what the cinema has to offer. It aims to engage users, direct them to relevant sections, and create a visually appealing first impression.</p>
        <p>Design:
            An automatic slideshow showcasing upcoming movies. Showcased as a dynamic loop to create a sense of motion and intrigue.

        </p>
        <p>The home page essentially has no other function than to be visually pleasing, and to make the user want to watch the showcased movies. This is also where news would be displayed, e.g. if there were to be an upcoming event at out movie theatre.</p>


        <h3>Booking: </h3>
        <p>Booking: The Booking page of MorroFilm AS is dedicated to enabling users to reserve tickets for upcoming movies. It provides a user-friendly interface to browse showtimes, and complete the booking process.

        <p>Design:
            An intuitive calendar or date picker to choose the desired movie date.

        <h2> Minimum Requirements </h2>

        <h3>This is the tentative plan of which we plan to fulfill the Minimum Requirements:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A JavaScript function that allows a user to click on any given film to 
                    display more information about the film. This is demonstrated in the mockups above. 
                    This pop-up window will also need a closing button to close the pop-up window. 
                    This will allow the user to gain a deeper understanding of Morrofilms movie selection and find 
                    the film they want to watch in an easy fashion. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For booking tickets, we plan to implement a JavaScript function that takes in the users name, 
                    selected movie and number of tickets. After the user clicks the button “Order”, 
                    the onclick-function should display a message to the user confirming the order and the details of the order. 
                    This function will also include form validation to make sure that the values the user input is valid. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The booking function will also implement a user-defined function which calculates the total price of the purchase. 
                    It should take two parameters, the price of the ticket and the number of tickets. a*b = c.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On the home-page we want to implement a setInterval function. 
                    This function will dynamically change between the current movies now being viewed in 
                    the cinema after a set amount of ms (milliseconds) . </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Plan </h2>

        <p> The following list is what we call an organizational scheme and will be the base for how we plan to organize all the files, folders etc. together in our group.
            Note that we are still in an early phase of the project, so it is quite hard to make a very accurate scheme, and there could absolotely be made changes to this scheme
            at a later time. The organizational scheme shown below is put in a folder called "Morrofilm AS" </p>

        <h3> Organizational Scheme: </h3>
